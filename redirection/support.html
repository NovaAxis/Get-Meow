                <h3>1. Information We Collect</h3>
                <p>
                    Meow and its creator/developer do NOT collect or store personal information such as IP addresses
                    or hardware identifiers (HWID). The only interaction with third-party services is through Discord
                    Rich Presence (RPC),
                    which is used solely to display activity status. Any data processed by Discord RPC is handled
                    according to
                    Discord’s own Privacy Policy. Our goal is to keep the project secure while respecting user privacy
                    and minimizing data collection.
                </p>

                <h3>2. Third-Party Services</h3>
                <p>
                    Meow uses Discord Rich Presence (RPC) exclusively to display user activity status. Any data
                    processed
                    through Discord RPC is handled in accordance with Discord’s Privacy Policy. Meow and its
                    creator/developer
                    do NOT collect or store IP addresses or other personal data through this service.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In the event that Meow is discontinued, the creator/developer may, at their discretion,
                    release the project as open-source so that others may continue its development. This decision
                    is solely at the discretion of the creator/developer and does not create any obligation.
